<p>Haiku is an open source operating system currently in development that specifically targets personal computing. Inspired by the Be Operating System, Haiku aims to become a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels.</p>

<h3>What's so good about Haiku anyway?</h3>

<p>The key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Specific focus on personal computing</li>
 <li>Custom kernel designed for responsiveness</li>
 <li>Fully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs</li>
 <li>Rich OO API for faster development</li>
 <li>Database-like file system (OpenBFS) with support for indexed metadata</li>
 <li>Unified, cohesive interface</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Haiku?</h3>

<p>The Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.</p>
